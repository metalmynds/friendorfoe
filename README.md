# Friend or Foe
Friend or Foe is an attempt to produce an automated malicious presence detection system.

The project is dependent on .Net Core 2.0

**Setup Instructions**

[ASP.NET Preview 2](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2017/06/28/introducing-asp-net-core-2-0-preview-2/)

The project now depends on Preview 4 so ensure you upgrade (via the Flag in VS 2017).

**Note**: Inital Issues with VS 2017 Preview 4 can cause the IDE to hang during a run.

**Resolution**: Create a fresh MVC 5 Project (in my case an Angular one) and started it in IISExpress, this fixed the issue with the FriendOrFoe project.
